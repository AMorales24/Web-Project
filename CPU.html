            <!--detail on CPU-->
            <p>The CPU's main purpose is to serve as a messenger, informing the other components of a computer of duties they are required to complete (Finnamore, 2017). This computer component follows a three part routine: "The CPU works by following a process known as 'fetch, decode and execute'" (Fastiggi).</p> 
            <!--detail on fetch decode execute, step names emphasized using strong tags-->    
            <h3>Fetch, Decode, Execute</h3>
            <p>The first step, <strong>fetch</strong>, consists of the CPU acting as a messenger to deliver a numbered message to the RAM (Frew, 2017). The number set is then kept in the instruction register (Frew, 2017). This process is carried out in order to retrieve "program and data" (Fastiggi).</p>  
            <p>The <strong>decode</strong> step is where the CPU attempts to correctly decipher the meaning of the of the message that was sent in the previous step (Fastiggi). The message is altered into signals so that it can be sent elsewhere in the CPU (Frew, 2017).</p>
            <p>In the <strong>execute</strong> step, the message is sent to specific parts of the CPU that can carry out its function (Frew, 2017).</p>
